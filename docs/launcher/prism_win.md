### Step 1 - Installing Java

First, we need to download and setup Java to be able to use Prism Launcher. Unlike the default Minecraft launcher, Prism does not come bundled with a default Java, and so we must install it ourselves.

Minecraft 1.16 and below all use Java 8, while 1.17 and above use Java 17. I recommend installing both to make it simpler to use different versions of Minecraft whenever you want.

In order to download Java, we will first head to the [Adoptium download page](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/). Adoptium is an open source Java that does not require a paid account to install, and is made by the Eclipse Foundation, a very reputable source. To install, we will use the dropdown boxes to make it easier to find the versions of Java we need

- Operating System: Windows
- Architecture: x64
- Package Type: JRE
- Version: 8 or 18 (download one of them, then download the other after)

Once we have chosen our download preferences, we will click the `.msi` download option. Once it's downloaded, run it and follow the installation process. Do this for both versions of Java.

### Step 2 - Installing Prism

[Download Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/). You will most likely want to download the `Installer (.exe)` version. Once it is finished downloading, it may give a warning screen saying "Windows protected your PC". Simply press the "More info" button, then "Run anyway"

Continue the installation process until you get to the "Java" screen. Here, you will decide which Java you want to set as the default for new instances. Click on the version that says "1.8" at the beginning of the version and has "Eclipse Foundation" in the path name. This is your Java 8 and it will be the default version of Java for every new instance you create on Prism. Of course, you can always change this later and can still manually specify a different version of Java whenever you want.

For the Minimum and Maximum memory allocation, leave them at 512 MiB and 4096 MiB respectively, unless you only have 8GB of ram or less, in which case you may want to cchange the maximum to 2048 MiB.

After this, continue with the installation process as normal.

### Step 3 - Logging in

Now that we've installed Prism, let's log in. Once Prism has launched, you should see a Steve head and "Profiles" text in the top right. Click on this and press "Manage Accounts". From here, click "Add Microsoft" on the right side menu. This will open a popup window, which will have a button to open the link to verify yourself and also copy the code. Simply paste the code into the window that opens up. Note, you may need to sign in to your Microsoft account first.

Once this is completed, you can exit back to the main Prism Launcher menu. Click on the button at the top left that says "Add Instance".

### Step 4 - Creating an Instance

This guide will focus on 1.8.9, but steps for other versions should also be obvious.

Click on the button on the top left that says "Add Instance". Name it whatever you want and giving a group for it is optional, but I do not recommend giving a group name until you need to better organize your instances.

Under the `Version` selector, scroll down till you find 1.8.9 and select it. Then in the `Mod Loader` tab underneath, choose Forge. It will automatically choose the latest version of Forge for 1.8.9 for you. Simply click "OK" to proceed. You should now be back on the main Prism page.

## Step 5 - Installing our mods

Now that we've installed Forge 1.8.9, we need to move all our mods to the new Prism Launcher folder. To do that, we'll right click our new instance and press `Edit`. Now, we'll go to the `Mods` tab. On the bottom right, there will be a button called `View Folder`. Click on this and you should be redirected to a file explorer tab. Now, open a new file explorer by either pressing `Win + E` on your keyboard or right clicking the file explorer icon and pressing "File Explorer". Navigate to your old .minecraft folder, which is `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft` (change USER to your computer's name, or if you don't know it, navigate there manually). Open the `.minecraft` file, then open the `skyclient` file if you were using Skyclient. Simply move everything in the skyclient folder into the Prism Launcher .minecraft folder that you opened earlier. Once this is done, you should be able to see all your mods in the Mods tab, and can launch the instance.

### Step 6 - Explore

Prism Launcher has a lot of things to offer, such as themes if you don't like the look of it, as well as a lot of options for your instances, including the ability to see all your mods, resource packs, and worlds in the launcher before launching. You can use these menus to install mods and resource packs, and even update mods if they are hosted on Modrinth or CurseForge!
