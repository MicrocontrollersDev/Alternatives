# Essential Alternatives

??? note "Essential sucks, click here to read why"

    Essential's new microtransaction system is predatory, purposefully designed to charge you more than what it would
    cost you prior to the new currency update. Essential now uses a new in-game currency in order to buy cosmetics,
    similar to Fortnite's V-Bucks. The amount of currency you can buy and the price of cosmetics is strategically
    placed so that you always have to buy more coins than you need to buy an item, forcing you to spend extra. This
    business practice is incredibly anticonsumer and profit driven, and is much different from their previous,
    respectable scheme where you paid directly for the item you wanted.
    
    Essential has tracking and data collection. This information may be shared to third parties as can be read in
    their [privacy policy](https://essential.gg/privacy-policy), as well as what data they collect.
    
    Essential is a half-baked mod. Almost every promise for new features has yet to be delivered since and
    before its release. Additionally, the features Essential currently has are purposefully made to be worse than
    other mods. Most obvious of this is their built in zoom, which despite all of its features being copied from
    Patcher, most of its functionality and customization was not added as to make it "less intimidating and easier
    for new players". Instead of using these half-baked and random features that can easily break with other mods,
    you should just use the free and open alternatives that have more features and are able to provide better
    support.

    Essential goes against the spirit of modern modding. There is no point for a mod loader when a singular mod tries
    to do everything, especially when it breaks everything else along the way. Using a mod loader means you have the
    freedom to use whatever mods you want. Don't feel tied down by Essential!

    Essential also tries to market itself as a mod library. Because of this, if another mod wants to use something
    Essential offers, all users of the mod are forced to install Essential alongside the original mod. There is no way
    around this. If you are a mod developer, please look elsewhere for the features Essential offers. Their libraries,
    Elementa, Vigilance, and UniversalCraft can all be used individually without the need of Essential, should you
    need to use them. There are other libraries such as OmniCore (UniversalCraft competitor), OneConfig (Vigilance
    competitor), and PolyUI (Elementa competitor). I especially recommend avoiding Vigilance in general, due to its
    myriad of issues that are known and acknowledged by the Essential devs, yet have not been fixed even years later.

Don't feel forced to use Essential!
