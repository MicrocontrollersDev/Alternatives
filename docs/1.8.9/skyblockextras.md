# SkyblockExtras Alternatives

SkyblockExtras is a mod that has many
incompatibilities, performance issues,
general issues, among other things.
For this reason, it is not recommended
to use the mod, and instead use other mods
that provide similar features.

List is a constant WIP. I do not own the
mod and this list is based off of an older
version of the mod. If you know of any
features/alternatives or would like to
confirm any of my guesses, feel free to
make a pull request and ping me on
[my discord server](https://discord.gg/rejfv9kFJj)
if you would like any further clarification
or a discussion.
