# SkyblockCatia Alternatives
SkyblockCatia is a mod which has
a bunch of features that are better
incorporated in other mods or are
useless, and also does not receive
many updates, with many incompatibilities
with other mods. Therefore, it is
recommended that you do not use it
if the features you use can be replaced.
