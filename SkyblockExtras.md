# SBE Alternatives - Work in Progress

SkyblockExtras is a mod that has many incompatibilities, performance issues, general issues, among other things. For this reason, it is not recommended to use the mod, and instead use other mods that provide similar features.

List is a WIP. Anything with just a ?, I either do not know of an alternative or I do not know what the feature even is. Anything with a ? after mod is things I think offer an alternative but I'm not sure of.
