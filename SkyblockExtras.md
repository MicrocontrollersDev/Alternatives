**Check out [SkyClient](https://discord.com/invite/VH6fdBYzQQ) for an instant installer & updater for the mods listed above and more!**

Note: It is not recommended that you use SkyblockCatia either since that mod has a large amount of incompatibilities with other mods, along with a bunch of features that aren't even for Skyblock, making it a very bloated mod.

# Reasons NOT to Buy or Use SBE:

- **Poorly made features**
    - [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/T3V8kDQ.png)
    - [Example 2](https://i.imgur.com/mFdaV2n.png)
    - [Example 3](https://i.imgur.com/yAtQ9ay.png)
    - [Example 4](https://i.imgur.com/gl0EF9g.png)
    - [Example 5](https://i.imgur.com/0BFk3yw.png)
    - [Example 6](https://i.imgur.com/rp1KVd5.png)
    - [Example 7](https://i.imgur.com/zXydj0j.png)
    - [Example 8](https://i.imgur.com/FkvZUbs.png)
    - NOTE: Due to SBE's paywall and obfuscation, we do not have access to the mod. Please open an issue or pull request if any of these features have been fixed.
- [**Obfuscated**](https://i.imgur.com/r5RROwf.png)
    - Context: This means we can't read the code unless we spend hours deciphering it. This makes the mod very unsafe as it could be doing anything behind the user's back. It also spams the user's logs and is used to hide stolen code.
- **Has very poor code**
    - [Using a mixin](https://i.imgur.com/ELNlotr.png) when they could use a forge event.
    - [Poorly made colored names](https://i.imgur.com/8sYs8bg.png) causing a decrease in FPS.
    - Can cause a 1 GB config folder to be created, as seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/WD3mPZg.png), [here](https://i.imgur.com/sF6LLQD.png), and [here](https://i.imgur.com/rOSAvgG.png).
    - [Compatibility issues](https://i.imgur.com/RA2gUpf.png)
    - Performance issues (see below).

    - [Testimony 1](https://i.imgur.com/bxJyO2X.png)
    - [Testimony 2](https://i.imgur.com/YX86ELc.png)
    - [Testimony 3](https://i.imgur.com/vpl5i2B.png)
    - [Testimony 4](https://i.imgur.com/ox4btVT.png)
    - SBE is notorious for destroying your FPS. The developers' attempt at fixing it was blatantly stealing FPS improvement features from Patcher.
       - While Skyblock mods in general are known to be heavy on performance, SBE has a much larger impact than any of its alternatives.
- **Use pirated software to protect against piracy**
    - The obfuscator used by SBE, Stringer 3.0.3 150202, is pirated.
- **Spams your logs**
    - [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/1jRDyni.png)
    - [Example 2](https://i.imgur.com/WwTWzrI.png)
    - [Example 3](https://i.imgur.com/ExwvQrU.png)
    - [Example 4](https://i.imgur.com/nIVikWF.png)
- **Blatantly steals from DSM**
    - The TicTacToe solver is identical.
- [**Blatantly steals from SBC**](https://i.imgur.com/n7T9DkB.png)
- **Blatantly steals from Patcher**
    - When patcher 1.5 was in beta and 1.12 crop hitboxes were added, they were bugged and broken. When the SBE developers "made" their version, they somehow managed to produce the exact same bug. Moulberry came in and fixed the glitch, resulting in the SBE developers claiming that they "found out" how to fix it.
        - [Side by side code comparison](https://hst.sh/xetawopini.java) showing that the code is now the exact same.
    - SBE has a chat timestamp feature, which while not being "stolen" per say, does not belong in a Skyblock mod anyways. If someone wants chat timestamps, they can get it through Patcher.
    - SBE developers claim that these features are "for people who don't use Patcher". However, Patcher is an all-purpose mod that brings many [bug fixes, performance improvements, and QOL features](https://github.com/LunaNotdev/Patcher-Explanation/blob/main/README.md) that everyone should be using regardless.
- [**Blatantly steals from NEU**](https://i.imgur.com/nNJp8bD.png)
    - NEU had originally made a feature that allowed you to re-texture skulls with custom models. On the SBE discord, they had expressly stated that they would not be stealing features from other mods and people should not request them to add stolen features. Moulberry was annoyed at SBE at the time for blatantly stealing features and was saying on stream he was going to add dungeon puzzle solvers to make SBE useless. It was only after that threat that they put out that statement, but when Moulberry decided against dungeon puzzle solvers, they went straight back to stealing.
- **Blatantly steals from Skytils**
    - Added necron phase timers literally the day after Skytils. One of the SBE developers also admitted to stalking the [Skytils github repository](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod).
- [**Uses ModCore**](https://i.imgur.com/fkWUtGi.png)
    - Despite breaking Sk1er's license, which is contemptible.
- [**Breaks MC EULA**](https://i.imgur.com/SyNXc9W.png)
    - Mojang can take down the mod at any time, which would have you lose $5. Calling it a "donation to the developers" doesn't change anything in the eyes of the law. The mod is advertised as paid, and is unlocked with money.
    - The SBE developers also do not seem to understand the EULA, as can be seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/Z0JbcBb.png). The section the developer brings up is not the correct section to be looking at and is irrelevant.
- **SBE developers take part in some fishy acts**
    - Illegally steal other people's work.
    - [Lie about other mods stealing from them](https://i.imgur.com/L7ilxLS.png).
    - Are rude to other mod developers and abuse any power they have over them. Things that they have done in the past (and continue doing) include but are not limited to:
        - Banning them from their own server and [other Skyblock servers](https://i.imgur.com/Bye0N9v.png).
        - Removing their roles in other servers.
        - Blocking them.
- **Rude staff**
    - [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/oWT1CJj.png)
    - [Example 2](https://i.imgur.com/ZjTpUCd.png)
    - [Example 3](https://i.imgur.com/pZ2y2mB.png)
    - [Example 4](https://i.imgur.com/GUek5Wb.png)
    - [Testimony 1](https://i.imgur.com/SIjMpFr.png)
    - [Testimony 2](https://i.imgur.com/Ax7HjOn.png)
    - If you have a problem with SBE, getting help on the SBE Discord server can be difficult. It is also hard to get help on any other discord server because of SBE's obfuscation and paywall.
- **Actually getting SBE is a pain**
    - To buy SBE, you have to be in their discord server, which requires phone authentication.
    - You will get automatically banned from the SBE server on mention of certain things, including this list, making it impossible to buy the mod.

# Rebuttal Against SBE Developers

## The first rebuttal

- An SBE developer claims that this list is full of false misinformation.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IVvbyjB.jpg" height="550px;" width="400px;"/>

- While the terms "false" and "misinformation" are used, The SBE developer in question makes no attempt to prove his claims regarding "false misinformation" being provided on this page. This is a brazen attempt to maintain their user base.

## The second rebuttal

- An SBE developer compiled a list of features that Skytils stole from SBE.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Uyvxads.png" height="609px;" width="783px;"/>

The following is a breakdown of why this is incorrect:

- **Nearby Burrow Particles** - Addon to Waypoints and is a straightforward feature.
- **Mythos Trackers**: Many Skyblock mods have some sort of item/drop trackers.
- **Display Mythos Loot** - Loot trackers are a common occurrence to be found in Skyblock mods.
- **Larger Heads** - Originally made to mimic newer Minecraft version behavior.
- **Big Items** - Originally showcased in Powns' PvP Essential mod a few years ago.
- **Puzzler Solver** - Appeared in NEU 6 days before SBE 2.0 showcase.
- **Show Ghosts** - Appeared in NEU 6 days before SBE 2.0 showcase.
- **Run Overview** - Many mods have this.
- **Score approximation** - Other mods have things similar to this but not as complex.
- **Dungeon Solvers** - Many mods do this. DungeonUtilities has had solvers for a very long time.
- **blankblaze.png** - This image is just a white rectangle. Either way, it has been replaced in Skytils with a better solution.
- **Prettify Dmg Markings** - Skytils has custom animation and coloring. Sychic had also started work on it long before Skytils was made.
- **Hide Dicer Msgs** - Skytils has a spam hider feature that is much more comprehensive than what SBE has. Dicer is just one of the things they include.
- **Hide Fishing Hooks** - Can be seen as an addon to NEU's fish line colors.

This is all without mentioning that this is missing the point. SBE is a paid mod which breaks EULA and has many downsides. Because of this, free mods will incorporate many features similar to SBE's. The SBE developers picked their poison when making the mod paid and obfuscated- these are the consequences of that.

# Even if you already bought SBE, do NOT use it!

If you already did buy it, the Sunk Cost Fallacy makes it so that you still should not use it. The money you spent is already long gone and no longer plays a factor in your decision making. Using the $5 as an excuse to continue using SBE is the irrational decision. Think of it as buying a broken spoon that barely works, and then finding a brand new and perfectly working one in your drawer. There is no reason to continue using the broken spoon. Even if you do use it, you are not getting your money's worth out of it. That money was thrown away and nothing can be done about it. The same applies for SBE; your money is gone. You may as well remove SBE from your mods folder.
