# SBE Alternatives - Work in Progress

SkyblockExtras is a mod that has many incompatibilities, performance issues, general issues, among other things. For this reason, it is not recommended to use the mod, and instead use other mods that provide similar features.

List is a WIP. Anything with just a ?, I either do not know of an alternative or I do not know what the feature even is. Anything with a ? after mod is things I think offer an alternative but I'm not sure of.

Since I also do not have a full list of features, this is going off of a relatively old YouTube video. There is nothing I can do about this until a list of features is released (why doesn't the paid mod already provide this... if I'm paying for something, I'd like to know what I'm paying for).
