**Check out [SkyClient](https://discord.com/invite/VH6fdBYzQQ) for an instant installer ~~& updater~~ for the mods listed above and more!**

Note: Using SkyblockCatia is not recommended, since it has many incompatibilities and some features that aren't even for Skyblock. It's the bloatiest mod I've ever seen, and the config menu is literal hell.

# Reasons NOT to Buy or Use SBE:
- [**Shitty puzzle solvers v1**](https://i.imgur.com/zXydj0j.png)
- [**Shitty features v1**](https://i.imgur.com/T3V8kDQ.png)
- [**Shitty features v2**](https://i.imgur.com/mFdaV2n.png)
- **Shit code**
    - Can tell by incompatibility nightmare
- [**Obfuscated to fuck**](https://i.imgur.com/r5RROwf.png) 
    - Context: This means we cant read the code unless we spend hours decrpyting it. This means that the mod is really unsafe as it can do anything such as pulling a JED (a mod that stole people's Minecraft accounts) and no one would know. It also makes it very easy for ComplexOrigin (SBE's creator) to hide the fact that he steals code (more on this later). If you crash, no one can help you, because the crashlog only consists of `iIiIiIiiIIiIiiIiIiiiIiIiIiIiiIiiiiIIIiiIiIiiIiiIiIiiIiiIiii` strings.

- **Use pirated software to protect against piracy**
    - You make enough money, pay for that shit.
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v1**](https://i.imgur.com/1jRDyni.png) (no one is going to want to help you after this)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v2**](https://i.imgur.com/WwTWzrI.png) (i dont understand how you can fuck up this badly)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v3**](https://i.imgur.com/ExwvQrU.png) (its not even funny anymore)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v4**](https://i.imgur.com/nIVikWF.png) (it's just depressing at this point)
- **Blatantly steals from DSM** (can't find screenshot but its the tic tac toe solver, it's literally the same thing, even printed the exact same log messages)
- [**Blatantly steals from SBC**](https://i.imgur.com/n7T9DkB.png)
- [**Blatantly steals from Patcher**](https://hst.sh/xetawopini.java) and also [this](https://i.imgur.com/1Ir8zjS.png) 
    - Context: When Patcher 1.5 was in beta, and 1.12 crop hitboxes were added, they were bugged and were pretty broken. When Complex "made" his version, he somehow managed to produce the exact same bug. Fishy. Moulberry then helped fix the Patcher glitch, and soon after, Complex had also magically fixed it.
    - In the SBE code and the Patcher code, there is code for crop hitboxes. Across the two mods, they are 100% identical. The ONLY changes made between the two mods is that the orders of the crops are slightly different. This aso ties into what was discussed above.

    - [SBE's Crop Hitboxes](https://hst.sh/odupiwadut.java)
- [**Blatantly steals from NEU**](https://i.imgur.com/nNJp8bD.png) 
    - Context: NEU had originally made a feature that allowed you to retexture skulls with custom models. On the SBE discord, they had specifically stated that they will not be stealing features from other mods and people should not request for them to add features from other mods, then added the same NEU feature.
- **Blatantly steals from Skytils**
    - Added necron phase timers literally the day after Skytils. Complex also stalks the Skytils github, most likely looking for code/features to steal, which is just scummy.
- [**Use ModCore despite breaking Sk1er mod licenses**](https://i.imgur.com/fkWUtGi.png)
    - Scummy and illegal
- [**Breaks MC EULA**](https://i.imgur.com/SyNXc9W.png) (no I don't know why "don't" looks messed up)
    - Mojang can take down the mod at any time and you'd lose $5. And no, calling it a "donation to Complex" doesn't change anything in the eyes of the law. The mod is advertised as paid, and is unlocked with money.
- [**Performance issues**](https://i.imgur.com/8sYs8bg.png), and [**even more performance issues**](https://i.imgur.com/bxJyO2X.png)
    - SBE is notorious for destroying your FPS. Their attempt at fixing it was stealing Patcher FPS optimisation features.

    - [What](https://i.imgur.com/WD3mPZg.png)
    - [The](https://i.imgur.com/sF6LLQD.png)
    - [Fuck](https://i.imgur.com/rOSAvgG.png)
- **Complex and AlphaElite are shitty human beings**
    - Illegally steal other people's work that they spent hundreds of hours on and make money off of it.
    - [Lie about other mods stealing from them](https://i.imgur.com/L7ilxLS.png) when they're the ones ripping off features
    - Are dicks to other mod developers (especially Moulberry)
    - Suck up to YouTubers to get them to defend them
    - Don't give these idiots money nor support
- **Shitty fucking staff holy shit**
    - [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/oWT1CJj.png)

    - Good luck getting any help from these idiots

# EVEN IF YOU ALREADY BOUGHT SBE, DO NOT USE IT!

- If you already did buy it, the Sunk Cost Fallacy makes it so that you still shouldn't use it. The money you spent is already long gone and no longer plays a factor in your decision making. Using the $5 as an excuse to continue using SBE is the irrational decision. Think of it as buying a broken spoon that barely works, and then finding a brand new working one in your drawer. There is no reason to continue using the broken spoon. Even if you do use it, you're not getting your money's worth out of it. That money was thrown away and nothing can be done about it. Same applies for SBE. Your money is gone. Remove SBE from your device.

# Now that I saved you $5, consider giving that money to me instead.
