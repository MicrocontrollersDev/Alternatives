# Todo List
lol

## Feather Client

* Move external mods into respective version categories ✅
* Figure out what to do about unrecommended mods (ie OptiFabric, DSM)
* Make SkyClient and Argon messages nicer and maybe move to bottom. ✅
* Forge/Fabric install guides? Maybe link to Lizzy's for Forge and MigratingToLatest for Fabric
* Figure out what to do about Feather missing mods for some versions (i.e., no Patcher 1.12)
  * patcher in specific is solved by Patcher being included in the general settings anyways, need to find out if anything else has the same issue)
* Make a final decision on 1.17. I don't see any reason to support it here, who is still playing 1.17? ✅
* add redaction for bold ✅

## Lunar Client

* add redaction for particle mod :x: (not up yet)
* add hytils reborn for uhc overlay ✅
* replace autofriend with hytils (they added that fsr?)✅
* add hytils for bedwars resource display 🟡

## All
the bannable on hypixel message is inconsistent across/within lists
decide on a design
