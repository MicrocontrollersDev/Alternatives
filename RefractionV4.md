# Remove
- **Modcore Container**
  - Modcore Container was a mod meant to give players Modcore before it was packaged in mods that needed it. It is now useless and could cause issues when Modcore 2 comes out.
- **Player API**
  - Player API used to be nessesary for Toggle Sneak mods to function, however it is now just useless.
- **AutoWho**
- **Skypixel**
  - Skypixel is old, not maintained, and has many features that are either useless, or simply do not work anymore.
- [**LabyMod**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/blob/main/LabyMod.md)
  - LabyMod causes many issues with other mods, and has many alternatives that can be used without messing up other mods.
