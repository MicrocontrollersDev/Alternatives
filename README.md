# Alternatives

# This is a place where alternatives to poorly made Minecraft mods as well as clients (and Chachy) can be stored.

This repo now serves primarily as an "alpha" version of [Proudmuslim's website](https://proudmuslim.tech/). Here is where I create initial changes and will then occasionally push these changes to his repo when I feel a substantial amount or important changes have been made. For this reason, information in here may sometimes be wrong or incomplete, but it will always be up to date.

# For Contributing:

Please follow the style that everything else is using, and add your name to the credits list yourself (in alphabetical order). While Proud's site does not currently have a list of people who contribured to this project, it will in the future. 

If you are going to update/add a mod, make sure that you change/add it on every list where applicable.

If changes are made that I do not like, I may cherrypick the changes myself, add you to the credits, and close the PR.

# Why was the repo disabled?

The repo was disabled for breaking TOS on the basis of harassment/bullying in the SBE alternatives list. After contacting GitHub support, I was able to get the repo back and make changes to remove anything that broke TOS. Thank you to everyone who supported me and these lists during that time!
