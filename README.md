# Alternatives

# This is a place where alternatives to poorly made Minecraft mods as well as clients (and Chachy) can be stored.

While this repo does serve as its own entity, it will also serve as an "alpha" version of [Proudmuslim's website](https://proudmuslim.tech/) where everything is much more organized, looks better, and is easier to navigate. Here is where I create initial changes and will then occasionally push these changes to his repo when I feel a substantial amount or important changes have been made.

# For Contributing:

Please follow the style that everything else is using, and add your name to the credits list yourself (in alphabetical order). While Proud's site does not currently have a list of people who contribured to this project, it will in the future. 

If you are going to update/add a mod, make sure that you change/add it on every list where applicable.

If changes are made that I do not like, I may cherrypick the changes myself, add you to the credits, and close the PR.

# Why was the repo disabled?

The repo was disabled for breaking TOS on the basis of harassment/bullying in the SBE alternatives list. After contacting GitHub support, I was able to get the repo back and make changes to remove anything that broke TOS. Thank you to everyone who supported me and these lists during that time!
