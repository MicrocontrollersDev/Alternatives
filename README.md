# Alternatives

## This is a place where alternatives to poorly made Minecraft mods/clients (and Chachy) can be stored together.

This is not final and may be discontinued. I got tired of having to watch 5-6 different repos and thought this would be easier. It should also make it easier for contributors as they can just make one PR instead of having to fork everything when a mod updates or whatever. Feedback is appreciated.

Ping me on discord at Microcontrollers#6733 or create an issue in the issues tab and let me know your thoughts.

# For Contributing:

Please follow the style that everything else is using, and add your name to the credits list yourself (in alphabetical order).
If you are going to update/add a mod, make sure that you change/add it on every list where applicable.

If changes are made that I do not like, I may cherrypick the changes myself, add you to the credits, and close the PR.

# Why was the repo disabled?

The repo was disabled for breaking TOS on the basis of harassment/bullying in the SBE alternatives list. After contacting GitHub support, I was able to get the repo back and make changes to remove anything that broke TOS. Thank you to everyone who supported me and these lists during that time!
