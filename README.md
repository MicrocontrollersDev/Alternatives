# Alternatives

# This is a place where alternatives to poorly made Minecraft mods as well as clients (and Chachy) can be stored.

This repo stores many alternatives to poorly made mods and clients for users who don't know much about this subject to learn from. Anybody may use this repo for their own work (such as but not limited to a website hosting these lists) as long as credit is properly given (my name and a link to this repo).

NOTE: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING ANYONE ELSE MADE USING THESE LISTS. ANYTHING ANYBODY ELSE ADDS OR CHANGES TO MY LISTS, INCLUDING UNMERGED PULL REQUESTS ON THIS REPO, DO NOT REPRESENT ME NOR MY OPINIONS.

As these lists have been around for a while and have taken up a lot of my time, it has become a low priority to me. For this reason, any contribution is welcomed and as this repo may slowly start to see less updates from me. If possible, please make a PR instead of reaching out to me on Discord. I usually check PRs relatively quickly.

# For Contributing:

Please follow the style that everything else is using, and add your name to the credits list yourself (in alphabetical order). While I would prefer if you linked to your GitHub, you may link to some other account of your if you wish.

If you are going to update/add a mod, make sure that you change/add it on every list where applicable.

If changes are made that I do not like, I may cherrypick the changes myself, add you to the credits, and close the PR.

I do not care about commit spam. I can squash and merge. Please don't commit spam on purpose though.

# Why was the repo disabled?

The repo was disabled for breaking TOS on the basis of harassment/bullying in the SBE alternatives list. After contacting GitHub support, I was able to get the repo back and make changes to remove anything that broke TOS. Thank you to everyone who supported me and these lists during that time!
